         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAny and Grievous are the crying Sins of our pre≈øent Age, among≈øt which the Prophanation of the Sacred Name of God is not the lea≈øt: For, Fir≈øt his Name is taken in vain by the abu≈øe of his Word, in curious and fruitle≈øs prating of it. Therefore one mu≈øt never talk of Gods Word, but that he may bring ≈øome Glory to God, and ≈øome good Edification to Men. As the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, Jude 20. <hi>Edifie one another in your mo≈øt holy Faith</hi> Unle≈øs this be our Scope, when ever we take Gods Word in our Mouths, to build up one another in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs, we pervert the Word of God, and take his Name in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Gods Word is polluted by us, when we ≈øpeak of his Word in Mockage, after a je≈øting and Scoffing manner. As tho≈øe did of whom <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øpeaketh, that derided the Doctrine of the la≈øt judgement: Ho, ≈øay they,

When will his coming be? As if they ≈øhould have ≈øaid, We hear a large di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, and here is much ado among the≈øe Preachers now a days, about the great and fearful day or Judgement, wherein (as they ≈øay) a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>s of Heaven, fooli≈øh vain Men, that have no Faith, make a Merriment and a Sport to laugh at this Doctrine. So in <hi>I≈øaiah,</hi> becau≈øe he told them of Death, the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øts fell to mocking: Come, ≈øay they, if we mu≈øt dye, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n let us take our Plea≈øure while we may: <hi>Let us Eat and Drink,</hi> and be Merry, <hi>for to morrow, Soul and Body, and all mu≈øt came to nothing;</hi> we will ply it while the time ≈øerveth. And thus the≈øe Irreligious bea≈øts ca≈øt off all the Exhortations of the Prophet, by Je≈øting and Scoffing.</p>
            <p>So, many lewd Per≈øons in the≈øe days are ready to ab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35794:5"/>and to di≈øgrace Chri≈øtian Patience. Oh ≈øhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs Per≈øons! will not the Reverence of Chri≈øt ≈øcare them from the abu≈øe of ≈øuch Words, as he with his own Mouth uttered? The≈øe be the Words of God, ≈øpoken and penned by the wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Holy Gho≈øt, for the direction and in≈øtruction of his Children; not for every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Swa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 chunk">

               </gap> and Drunkard to vomit out of his filthly Mouth, to move laughter with them. And this is a common thing among≈øt fan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>a≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Companions, that de≈øire to be thought witty and conceited; that if any place of Scripture ≈øerve their tu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>n, to gird or quip one another, or ≈øuch like purpo≈øe: They had rather God ≈øhould lo≈øe his Glory, and Gods Word the Grace and Authority of it, than that they would lo≈øe their Je≈øt. And thus that which God appointed to edify their Souls in Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, they pervert to ≈øtir up them≈øelves and others, to Fooli≈øh, Wicked and Prophane Laughter.</p>
            <p>So thirdly, The Word of God is abu≈øed in a mo≈øt mo≈øt gro≈øs and notorious manner, when one brings it in the defence of any Sin, Error, or Here≈øie. Which is to pre≈øume to wre≈øt Gods weapons out of his Hands, as it were, to wound him with his own Sword. This is as grevious an abu≈øe of the Sacred Word of God, and as Hu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>tful and Mi≈øchievous as Swearing. Thus the Devil did mo≈øt damnably profane Gods Word, that it might ≈øeem to agree with his devilli≈øh Temptations.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:35794:6"/>
            <p> So, let wicked and volumptuous Livers, that ≈øpend all their time and labour in pur≈øuing vain and fond Sports and Games, and ≈øuch foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh and fle≈øhly delights, as make them no whit more Serviceable to God, or the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or apt to do good to their own Souls and Bodies, or any Mans el≈øe: Let ≈øuch men (I ≈øay) be reproved, and told, that this kind of living is not allowable, it will not hold out before God; Man was made to Glorify God, and to do good unto Men, not to ≈øeek plea≈øure to his Fle≈øh, and live idely in the World; and therefore they mu≈øt repent and amend; you ≈øhall have an excu≈øe ≈øtrait, Gods Word mu≈øt be brought as a defence; they do not break Gods Commandments without warrant out of tte Scripture, if you will believe them. What (≈øay they) will you have a Man live without Delight? Do not you allow Recreation? Why the Scripture doth afford a Man Recreation; and then a number of places mu≈øt be brought in for Recreation, to maintain their volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuou≈øne≈øs. But, (vain Man) doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture command a vocation, and the Recreation as an help to further us in it? Now if one may ask you that ≈øtand ≈øo much for Recreation, what is your Occupation? What ≈øore I ravel is it that wearieth your Body? VVhat earne≈øt ≈øtudy troubleth your Brain, that you mu≈øt have ≈øo much refre≈øhing, and ≈øo much Recreation? It mu≈øt be ≈øome very painful Labour, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35794:6"/>needeth ≈øo much re≈øt to make you able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. It is a ≈øore labour indeed, for it is the ≈øervice of Lu≈øt and the Devil, two hard Ma≈øters. But this turning of Recreation into a Vocation, or a Vexation rather, it is not allowable by Gods Word; how dare≈øt thou then be ≈øo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently audacious, as to rob God of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure to maintain thy filthy Lu≈øt, and defile his Holy Word, by defending thy unholy practice.</p>
            <p>So likewi≈øe come to a Covetuous Per≈øon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him for his Cruelty and Oppre≈ø≈øion, ≈øhew him that the love of the World is enmity to God, and that Covetuou≈øne≈øs is Idolatry, then comes in this place of Scripture, which mu≈øt ≈øalve all: What, hath not God commanded a Man to labour in his calling? Doth not God ≈øay, <hi>He is wor≈øe than an Infidel that provideth not for his Family?</hi> And ≈øo all mu≈øt go under the good name of Husbandry and Thrift, and Providing for his Family. But con≈øider thou that ≈øtande≈øt thus for thy labour, God will have thee labour, but not to ≈øerve thy ≈øelf, and thine own Lu≈øts in thy labour; take pains in thy call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but hurt not thy Neighbour by it, provide for thy Children, and lay up, but withall lay up thy trea≈øure in Heaven e≈øpecially, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide to bring them up in the fear of God in ≈øome Chri≈øtian Vocation. Fir≈øt provide that they may be Chri≈øtians, and then thou ha≈øt well provided for them. Store up mercifull works; for if we be Righteous, Merciful, and Lend,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35794:7"/>our Seed ≈øhall injoy the ble≈ø≈øing. Thus God will have one labour with Godline≈øs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ≈øo for his Children, as that he mu≈øt al≈øo provide for his own Soul.</p>
            <p>So come to Angry and Pa≈ø≈øionate Per≈øons, they likewi≈øe can have ≈øomething to ≈øay for their ≈øins, and that out of Gods Word, when the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

               </gap>ooli≈øh and unadvi≈øed Pa≈ø≈øions, tell them, this is nought. <hi>Anger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteth in the bo≈øome of Fuels,</hi> and <hi>the wrath of Man fulfilleth not the Law of God.</hi> Eccle≈ø. 7.11.
